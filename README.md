As a beginner we all facing difficulty to use Django in a #virtual_environment. Today I am going to show you how you can create virtual environment and install Django on it. Let’s get started………
Step 1:For #Python 3.3 and later, #venv is available as a built-in module. Write the below command in your VS code terminal and press enter -> py -m venv room_1
Here room_1 is the name of your virtual environment, you can use any name you want.
Step 2:Now activate virtual environment by writing the command and press enter:  .\room_1\Scripts\activateHere room_1 is the name of your virtual environment. Here you go, your virtual environment is activated.
Step 3:Now run the following command for Django installation -> pip install django
Now Django installation is started.
Step 4:If you want to deactivate your virtual environment, just run the command: deactivate
django-admin startproject chat
